# Kokoro-FastAPI-Colab

A ready-to-run Google Colab notebook for deploying Kokoro text-to-speech API with GPU acceleration and public access via Cloudflare.

## Features

- One-click launch of Kokoro TTS API on Google Colab with T4 GPU
- Automatic Cloudflare tunnel creation for public access
- Compatible with SillyTavern and other applications as an OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint
- Pre-configured with all necessary setup steps

## Quick Start

Click the button below to open this project in Google Colab with T4 GPU acceleration:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CY83R-3X71NC710N/Kokoro-FastAPI-Colab/blob/main/launch_kokoro.ipynb?accelerator=gpu&colab=true)

## Usage

1. Click the "Open In Colab" button above
2. In Colab, go to Runtime â†’ Change runtime type and select "T4 GPU" 
3. Run the notebook
4. The notebook will set up Kokoro TTS and create a public URL via Cloudflare
5. Use the generated URL in SillyTavern or other applications

## Helper Terminal Program

A helper script is included (`detect_cloudflare_url.py`) that can launch the Colab notebook and automatically extract the Cloudflare URL from the output. Run it with:

```bash
python detect_cloudflare_url.py
```
